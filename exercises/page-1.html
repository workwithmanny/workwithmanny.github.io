      <h1>A Tale of Two Cities</h1>

      <p>
        It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of
        wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it
        was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the
        season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of
        despair.
      </p>

      <p>
        We had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going
        direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way â€“ in short, the
        period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest
        authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the
        superlative degree of comparison only.

        There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the
        throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a
        fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer
        than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes,
        that things in general were settled for ever.

        All these things, and a thousand like them, came to pass in and close
        upon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.
        Environed by them, while the Woodman and the Farmer worked unheeded,
        those two of the large jaws, and those other two of the plain and the
        fair faces, trod with stir enough, and carried their divine rights with
        a high hand.

        A wonderful fact to reflect upon, that every human creature is
        constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other. A
        solemn consideration, when I enter a great city by night, that every one
        of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret; that every
        room in every one of them encloses its own secret; that every beating
        heart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there, is, in some of its
        imaginings, a secret to the heart nearest it!
