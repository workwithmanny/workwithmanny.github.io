        <em>Purple Rain</em> is a song by American musician Prince and his
        backing band The Revolution. It is the title track from the 1984 album

      <h2>ORIGINS</h2>
      <p>
        Originally written as a country song and intended to be a collaboration
        with Stevie Nicks, Prince explained the meaning of the song as follows:
        <em
          >"When there's blood in the sky... red and blue = purple. Purple rain
          pertains to the end of the world and being with the one you love and
          letting your faith/god guide you through the purple rain."</em
        >
      </p>

      <h2>RECORDING</h2>
      <p>
        The song was recorded during a benefit concert for the Minnesota Dance
        Theatre at the First Avenue nightclub in Minneapolis on August 3, 1983.
        <em>City Pages</em> described the 70-minute performance as Prince's
        <em>"sweatiest and most soulful hometown concert yet."</em>
      </p>

      <h2>RECEPTION AND LEGACY</h2>
